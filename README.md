## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `>=16`
- [npm][npm] v8.16.0 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].


```
git clone 
cd bookshelf
node setup
```

```
npm install
npm run validate
```

If you are still unable to fix issues and you know how to use Docker üê≥ you can
setup the project with the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```


## Working through the exercises

To get started, run:

```shell
node go
```

This will allow you to choose which exercise you want to work on. From there,
open the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file and follow the instructions.

If you'd like to work on an extra credit, but you want to skip the preceding
steps, you can run `node go` again:

```shell
node go
```
